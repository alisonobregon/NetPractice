# NetPractice

## Description

NetPractice is an introductory networking project from the 42 curriculum.  
Its objective is to understand and apply fundamental networking concepts through practical configuration exercises.

The project focuses on TCP/IP networking principles, including IP addressing, subnet masks, default gateways, routing, and the role of network devices such as routers and switches. By completing each level, students gain a clear understanding of how hosts communicate within the same network and across different networks, following the TCP/IP stack and the OSI model.

NetPractice is a theoretical project completed using an interactive web-based training interface provided by 42.

## Instructions

### Running the Training Interface

1. Access the NetPractice project from the 42 intra.
2. Open the training interface by launching the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Complete each level by configuring:
   - IP addresses
   - Subnet masks
   - Default gateways
   - Routing tables (when required)

A level is validated once all hosts can communicate correctly according to the given topology.

---

### Exporting Configurations

- After successfully completing a level, use the **export** option provided in the interface.
- This will generate a configuration file corresponding to the completed level.
- Repeat this process for all levels.

---

### Submission Requirements

- The repository must contain **10 exported configuration files**.
- There must be **one configuration file per level**.
- All exported files must be placed **at the root of the repository**.
- No additional files or directories are required.

## Resources

### Networking Concepts Studied

The following networking concepts are covered in this project:

- TCP/IP addressing

### References

- RFC 791 — Internet Protocol (IP)
- RFC 793 — Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
- OSI Model documentation

### Use of Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence tools were used in a limited manner to assist with the understanding of certain networking concepts and to improve documentation clarity. All network configurations, validations, and exported files were completed independently by the student.

## Notes

NetPractice provides a solid foundation in computer networking, which is essential for system administration, network communication, and low-level programming concepts within the 42 curriculum.
